# queue-manager
A GitHub App that manages the queue for PRs ready to merge.

## Details
- When the `READY FOR MERGE` label is added to the PR, a `QUEUED FOR MERGE #X` label will be added to the PR. The `X`  will be the next open spot in the queue.

- If all the `QUEUED FOR MERGE #X` labels are assigned (no more spots in the queue), the `QUEUE IS CURRENTLY FULL` label will appear on the PR. The assignee needs to remove the `READY FOR MERGE` label and `QUEUE IS CURRENTLY FULL` labels, and wait a few minutes before re-applying back to the queue. To re-apply into the queue, just add the `READY FOR MERGE` label to the PR again.

- The queue is updated when any of the `QUEUED FOR MERGE #X` labels is removed in any of the PRs. Each of the PRs containing these labels will have updated queue labels.
